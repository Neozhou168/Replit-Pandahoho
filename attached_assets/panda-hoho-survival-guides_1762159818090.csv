How to Get a FREE Visa to China?,"China offers a 240-hour free transit visa for eligible short-stay travelers. Before you fly, confirm your nationality, permitted entry ports, and allowed travel zones on the official policy page: https://en.nia.gov.cn/n147413/c183100/content.html .Each stay must be under 240 hours and you must hold a confirmed onward ticket to a third country or region (you can’t just fly back to your origin). There’s no hard cap on repeat use if you meet the rules. Save screenshots/print your tickets, hotel confirmations, and the policy, and be polite and clear with immigration officers.",China,https://res.cloudinary.com/dkv6zeutb/image/upload/v1755869465/image_ikxria.png,https://youtu.be/msLfRGKWHLQ,"22/08/2025, 14:53:14"
How to get mobile data in China using eSIM?,"Want stable and affordable mobile data in China? eSIM is the solution. Sign up for Nomad eSIM before your trip and check your device’s compatibility. Choose an unlimited throttled plan with hotspot tethering. Set up the eSIM before you arrive, as Nomad’s website is blocked in China. If needed, use a VPN to activate it after landing. With this setup, you can stay connected without the hassle of a physical SIM card. For detailed installation, check out the tutorial video.",China,https://res.cloudinary.com/dkv6zeutb/image/upload/v1755874705/image_20250822225739_b24923410952267edefbcf0c0006495d_u2gdoy.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ZKl58nlT0,"22/08/2025, 14:52:41"
How to Get Mobile Data in China — eSIM or SIM?,"Need data in China? eSIM is highly recommended. But if your phone lacks eSIM, grab a mainland SIM for stable coverage. Airport SIMs are instant but costlier—buy cheaper in the city. Avoid Wuyishan Airport. For more detail, watch the quick demo below.
PS: If you swap to a new Chinese SIM after arrival, update your apps’ phone bindings (WeChat, Alipay, ride/booking apps). Go to each app’s Account/Settings → Phone Number, enter the new number and complete SMS verification so payments and bookings keep working.",China,https://res.cloudinary.com/dkv6zeutb/image/upload/v1755874471/image_20250822225403_d97097cbae2c51a9e5cb8a19cfd16933_ayndlb.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCeDpR5U8Qk,"22/08/2025, 14:52:10"
"How to access Google, TikTok and Instagram in China?","Having trouble accessing Instagram, Google, or other blocked apps in China? A reliable VPN solves that. Install ExpressVPN on all your devices before you arrive (its site is blocked in mainland China). Disable auto-renew before your trip ends to avoid surprise charges, save the support email and setup screenshots, and keep a backup VPN (we recommend VPN.ac) in case of issues. Expect slower or dropped connections in remote areas like Xinjiang or Tibet, but ExpressVPN generally offers the most stable performance.

How to Pay in China?,"China is ~90% cashless—no Alipay, big headaches. Download Alipay before you go (iPhone: App Store; Android: Google Play or APK at https://mobile.alipay.com). Do not install the Hong Kong version—mini-apps won’t work. Link your phone number (turn on intl roaming or grab a mainland SIM if SMS codes don’t arrive). Carry small bills (¥1/5/10/20) for street food and use Bank of China ATMs for cash (they dispense cash before returning your card—don’t forget it!). Tell your bank you’ll be in China to avoid card blocks.",China,https://res.cloudinary.com/dkv6zeutb/image/upload/v1755873708/image_20250822224114_28c44a3c370d2811ecff913af5ede154_xcixuc.jpg,https://youtu.be/3xEM6Hkn_EY,"22/08/2025, 14:42:08"

At the table, tap “Chats → + → Scan,” open the order page, then “⋯ → Translate” to read the menu.

How to Get INSTANT Tax Refund in China?,"China’s VAT-refund system is super smooth—shop and refund on the go.
