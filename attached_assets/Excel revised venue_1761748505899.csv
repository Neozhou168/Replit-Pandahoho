It was known as Fuying Chan Yuan in the Sui Dynasty; later Tang-era famed painter Wu Daozi created a Guanyin depiction here, giving the temple its early name Guanyin Temple 

Renamed Wolong Temple (â€œSleeping-Dragon Templeâ€) during the Song Dynasty after monk Weiguo styled himself Wolong; in 1901, during the Boxer Rebellion, Empress Dowager Cixi donated and renovated the temple, enriching its collection with Mongolian and Tibetan statues, alongside a large bell cast in 1033

Composed of front courtyard, Shanmen (gate), incense spring, Lingguang Hall, and the main Xiangzi Hall, with North and South side courtyards, all built in Ming-style craftsmanship during restoration.

ğŸ“œ Historical Legacy
Guangji Temple, originally Xiliucun Temple, was founded in the Jin dynasty (1115â€“1234) and rebuilt during the Ming dynasty. Elevated to â€œHongci Guangjiâ€ in 1466 by imperial decree, it later served as the cityâ€™s major Han Buddhist temple and today houses the headquarters of the Chinese Buddhist Association 

ğŸŒŸ Architectural Highlights
Classic axis: The temple unfolds symmetrically along its central axisâ€”main gate, bell/drum towers, Heavenly King Hall, Mahavira Hall, Guanyin Hall, Treasure House/Sutra Pavilion, and the revered Abstinence Altar, the only intact Qing dynasty ordination platform in the city 

Art treasures: The Mahavira Hall houses the Three Buddhas of Past, Present, and Future, Ming-era bronze Arhats, a 1793 bronze cauldron, and a rare 10â€¯Ã—â€¯5â€¯m finger-painting of the â€œVictorious Audible Soundâ€ by imperial order 

Scripture trove: Its library preserves over 170,000 sutras in 23 languages, including Song and Ming blood-written texts and a complete 231-chapter Tibetan edition from 18th-century block printing 

ğŸ™ Why Itâ€™s Special
Spiritual calm in the city: A peaceful retreat amid bustling Xicheng Districtâ€”by Three-Faiths Temple, Beihai Park, and Shijia Templeâ€”offering reflective tranquility 

Living heritage: Once a center for Qing dynasty ordinations, it remains a major monastery with ongoing rituals. The abbot is Shi Yanjue 

Cultural continuity: As a national key cultural protection site and headquarters of the Buddhist Association, it blends ancient architecture with modern religious life

Originally part of the Ming dynastyâ€™s Eastern Imperial Garden (Hongqing Palace), this site evolved from a royal residence to the mansion of Prince Regent Dorgon in the early Qing era, later becoming a Gelugpa (Tibetan) Buddhist monastery in 1694, and renamed Pudu Temple by Emperor Qianlong in 1776 

Itâ€™s one of the â€œEight Temples outside the Forbidden Cityâ€, though modest in size, its significance lies in its fusion of Manchu palace structure and Tibetan-Buddhist temple formâ€”notably built on a raised platform with low windows: a unique Manchu-style artifact 

ğŸŒŸ Highlights to Discover
A modest complex featuring Shanmen Gate, Ciji Main Hall (inscribed by Qianlong), and traditional Tibetan-style elementsâ€”Bell & Drum towers, Buddha image halls 

Elevated temple square offers modern visitors a quiet refuge with a view of Beijingâ€™s Forbidden City corner tower across the lane 

Surrounded now by a residential hutong district, the temple has retained its solemn temple setting within a living neighborhood 

ğŸ‘¥ Who Should Visit
Cultural historians and architecture fans curious about Qing-era use of Tibetan Buddhism in the imperial city.

Photographers & heritage seekers seeking offâ€‘beaten, quietly stunning temple spaces with unique architectural features.

Travelers desiring tranquilityâ€”here is a calm â€œsecret nookâ€ less crowded than nearby landmark spots.

Tucked away in the historic Xuannan district, Lanman Hutong is a narrow, winding alley that quietly preserves the authentic flavor of old Beijing. Unlike the commercialized Nanluoguxiang, this hutong feels lived-in, peaceful, and rich with everyday stories.

ğŸŒŸ Highlights:
Old red doors with copper knockers, faded slogans from the 1970s, creeping ivy on grey walls.
Locals sipping tea, cats lounging under eaves, and that special kind of ""quiet city hum"" only found in these untouched corners.
A perfect detour from nearby Fayuan Temple and Xuannan Bookstore, especially if you love to explore on foot.
This is not a place to check off your sightseeing list â€” itâ€™s a place to breathe, notice, and wander slowly.

ğŸ•°ï¸ Best Time to Visit:
Morning or late afternoon, when the soft sunlight slants through the brick walls and doorways, casting beautiful shadows â€” perfect for photography and quiet walks.
Spring and autumn are ideal, when the weather is crisp and the hutong life spills gently into the alleyways.

ğŸ‘¥ Who Itâ€™s For:
Solo travelers, photographers, urban sketchers, and anyone chasing Beijingâ€™s slower, more poetic side.
Locals and culture lovers looking for hidden gems away from the tourist crowds.","ğŸ•°ï¸ Best Time to Visit:
