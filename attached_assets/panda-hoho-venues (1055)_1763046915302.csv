Renamed Wolong Temple (“Sleeping-Dragon Temple”) during the Song Dynasty after monk Weiguo styled himself Wolong; in 1901, during the Boxer Rebellion, Empress Dowager Cixi donated and renovated the temple, enriching its collection with Mongolian and Tibetan statues, alongside a large bell cast in 1033

Originally part of the Ming dynasty’s Eastern Imperial Garden (Hongqing Palace), this site evolved from a royal residence to the mansion of Prince Regent Dorgon in the early Qing era, later becoming a Gelugpa (Tibetan) Buddhist monastery in 1694, and renamed Pudu Temple by Emperor Qianlong in 1776 

It’s one of the “Eight Temples outside the Forbidden City”, though modest in size, its significance lies in its fusion of Manchu palace structure and Tibetan-Buddhist temple form—notably built on a raised platform with low windows: a unique Manchu-style artifact 

🌟 Highlights to Discover
A modest complex featuring Shanmen Gate, Ciji Main Hall (inscribed by Qianlong), and traditional Tibetan-style elements—Bell & Drum towers, Buddha image halls 

Elevated temple square offers modern visitors a quiet refuge with a view of Beijing’s Forbidden City corner tower across the lane 

Surrounded now by a residential hutong district, the temple has retained its solemn temple setting within a living neighborhood 

👥 Who Should Visit
Cultural historians and architecture fans curious about Qing-era use of Tibetan Buddhism in the imperial city.

Photographers & heritage seekers seeking off‑beaten, quietly stunning temple spaces with unique architectural features.

Travelers desiring tranquility—here is a calm “secret nook” less crowded than nearby landmark spots.

Step off the beaten tourist path and discover Fayuan Temple, one of Beijing’s oldest and most serene Buddhist temples. Originally built in AD 645 during the Tang Dynasty, this quiet sanctuary offers a peaceful retreat from the city’s hustle, filled with ancient cypress trees, elegant courtyards, and timeless architecture.

Unlike the crowded temples near the city center, Fayuan Temple remains a hidden jewel, frequented more by monks and scholars than by tourists. It is home to the China Buddhist Academy and holds deep spiritual and academic significance in Chinese Buddhism.

Whether you're a lover of history, culture, or simply seeking a moment of calm, Fayuan Temple invites you to slow down, breathe in the incense-scented air, and connect with centuries of devotion and wisdom.
