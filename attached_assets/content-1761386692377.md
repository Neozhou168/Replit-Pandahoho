**How to Get a FREE Visa to China?** \\
\\
China offers a 240-hour free transit visa for eligible short-stay travelers. Before you fly, confirm your nationality, permitted entry ports, and allowed travel zones on the official policy page: https://en.nia.gov.cn/n147413/c183100/content.html .Each stay must be under 240 hours and you must hold a confirmed onward ticket to a third country or region (you can’t just fly back to your origin). There’s no hard cap on repeat use if you meet the rules. Save screenshots/print your tickets, hotel confirmations, and the policy, and be polite and clear with immigration officers.](https://pandahoho.com/SurvivalGuideDetail?id=68a8845aa7cd680f1469391a) [![How to get mobile data in China using eSIM?](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkv6zeutb/image/upload/v1755874705/image_20250822225739_b24923410952267edefbcf0c0006495d_u2gdoy.jpg)\\

**How to get mobile data in China using eSIM?** \\
\\
Want stable and affordable mobile data in China? eSIM is the solution. Sign up for Nomad eSIM before your trip and check your device’s compatibility. Choose an unlimited throttled plan with hotspot tethering. Set up the eSIM before you arrive, as Nomad’s website is blocked in China. If needed, use a VPN to activate it after landing. With this setup, you can stay connected without the hassle of a physical SIM card. For detailed installation, check out the tutorial video.](https://pandahoho.com/SurvivalGuideDetail?id=68a884399531b02bf75848e1) [![How to Get Mobile Data in China — eSIM or SIM?](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkv6zeutb/image/upload/v1755874471/image_20250822225403_d97097cbae2c51a9e5cb8a19cfd16933_ayndlb.jpg)\\

**How to Get Mobile Data in China — eSIM or SIM?** \\
\\
Need data in China? eSIM is highly recommended. But if your phone lacks eSIM, grab a mainland SIM for stable coverage. Airport SIMs are instant but costlier—buy cheaper in the city. Avoid Wuyishan Airport. For more detail, watch the quick demo below.\\
PS: If you swap to a new Chinese SIM after arrival, update your apps’ phone bindings (WeChat, Alipay, ride/booking apps). Go to each app’s Account/Settings → Phone Number, enter the new number and complete SMS verification so payments and bookings keep working.](https://pandahoho.com/SurvivalGuideDetail?id=68a8841a026f4126a4d33593) [![How to access Google, TikTok and Instagram in China?](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkv6zeutb/image/upload/v1755874137/image_20250822224828_178d57b6ed9d5639a3454f0286936d47_kqt5md.jpg)\\

**How to access Google, TikTok and Instagram in China?** \\
\\
Having trouble accessing Instagram, Google, or other blocked apps in China? A reliable VPN solves that. Install ExpressVPN on all your devices before you arrive (its site is blocked in mainland China). Disable auto-renew before your trip ends to avoid surprise charges, save the support email and setup screenshots, and keep a backup VPN (we recommend VPN.ac) in case of issues. Expect slower or dropped connections in remote areas like Xinjiang or Tibet, but ExpressVPN generally offers the most stable performance. Watch the setup tutorial if you need.](https://pandahoho.com/SurvivalGuideDetail?id=68a8836ba2a34a584d1ddc20) [![How to Pay in China?](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkv6zeutb/image/upload/v1755873708/image_20250822224114_28c44a3c370d2811ecff913af5ede154_xcixuc.jpg)\\

**How to Pay in China?** \\
\\
China is ~90% cashless—no Alipay, big headaches. Download Alipay before you go (iPhone: App Store; Android: Google Play or APK at https://mobile.alipay.com). Do not install the Hong Kong version—mini-apps won’t work. Link your phone number (turn on intl roaming or grab a mainland SIM if SMS codes don’t arrive). Carry small bills (¥1/5/10/20) for street food and use Bank of China ATMs for cash (they dispense cash before returning your card—don’t forget it!). Tell your bank you’ll be in China to avoid card blocks.](https://pandahoho.com/SurvivalGuideDetail?id=68a881c01dd78e7f0a3cf41a) [![How do I use QR codes to order food in China?](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkv6zeutb/image/upload/v1755873479/image_20250822223724_be2189f047ab711532be6910c3fdabd0_dmxaxh.jpg)\\

**How do I use QR codes to order food in China?** \\
\\
Most fast-casual spots use QR-code self-ordering—so get your WeChat ready. Install the latest WeChat (App Store / Google Play / APK), link your bank under “Chats → + → Money,” and enable international roaming or get a mainland SIM for SMS verification. At the table, tap “Chats → + → Scan,” open the order page, then “⋯ → Translate” to read the menu. Pay by scanning the merchant’s code or showing your own QR in “Money.” For tricky names, use a photo+voice translation app. If you haven't got your WeChat ready, check out the vid.](https://pandahoho.com/SurvivalGuideDetail?id=68a880ef47c632c64366cbbe) [![How to Get INSTANT Tax Refund in China?](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkv6zeutb/image/upload/v1755872964/IMG_2964_xtiphl.jpg)\\

**How to Get INSTANT Tax Refund in China?** \\
\\
China’s VAT-refund system is super smooth—shop and refund on the go. Look for the “Tax Refund” sign: many participating stores offer IMMEDIATE in-city refunds. Remember your purchases must leave China within 90 days or you may need to repay the tax. Always keep every original invoice and refund form. If instant refund isn’t available, claim VAT at your departure hall before you leave—allow extra time at check-in.

**How to Book Travel & Stay in China？** \\
\\
Alipay can book flights, high-speed trains, hotels and attraction tickets all in one place—no extra apps required. Remember real-name verification is mandatory for bookings; during train peak seasons book 3–5 days ahead and reserve popular attractions 1–3 days (7 days for places like the Forbidden City). If you can’t find the booking page, search “Trip” in Alipay and ☆-favorite the mini program. Most train and attraction tickets are e-tickets—keep screenshots of bookings and carry your passport for manned-counter assistance if needed.](https://pandahoho.com/SurvivalGuideDetail?id=68a87bc54cec01cfc51cca5b)
