## Jingshan Park（景山公园）

Beijing, China

Here’s a scenic glimpse from Jingshan Park, showcasing its leafy hilltop with Chinese pavilion roofs against modern Beijing’s skyline—a perfect start to your journey north of the Forbidden City!

🌳🏯 Jingshan Park – A Serene Summit Over Imperial Beijing
Perched atop the artificial Jingshan Hill, right behind the Forbidden City, Jingshan Park is a historic imperial garden transformed into a public oasis. Originally built during the Ming Dynasty, the 23-hectare park features five hilltop pavilions and centuries-old cypress trees, offering a stunning vantage point over the Forbidden City and the modern city beyond

Ancient, fragrant, scenic cypress- and peony-filled gardens
Architectural, cultural, symbolic pavilions and twin summits
Vibrant, daily, community scenes featuring tai chi, opera singers, and local dancers

🧭 Visitor Tips:
Best time: Early morning (6–9 AM) for quiet strolls and local culture; sunset for golden-hued city views
Entry fee: Approx. ¥2–5; open early and late (6 AM–9 PM in summer, slightly shorter in winter)
Accessibility: Park paths are wheelchair-friendly, but summit requires stair climbing
Photography tips: Head to Wanchun Pavilion for iconic Forbidden City vistas; autumn peonies bloom in May, golden leaves in fall
