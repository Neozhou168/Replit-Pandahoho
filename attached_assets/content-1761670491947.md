Favorite

A Journey Across Beijing’s Ancient Mountain Fortresses，from the famous Badaling and scenic Mutianyu, to the wild beauty of Jinshanling and Simatai, and the lakeside charm of Huanghuacheng. Each section reveals a different side of China’s history and landscape — where ancient stones wind through mountains, forests, and water, telling timeless stories under the northern sky.
